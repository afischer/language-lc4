### Syntax highlighting and autocompletion for LC-4 Assembly

This tool allows you to highlight opcodes, registers, and TRAPS, and other
elements for use with the Little Computer 4 (LC-4) Assembly language designed
by the University of Pennsylvania CIS department.

### Thanks
- Many grammar rules and syntax highlighting RegExes from  [wufufufu](https://github.com/wufufufu)'s Sublime package. [here](https://github.com/wufufufu/Sublime-LC3).
- Some RegExes borrowed from [dashwin/Sublime-LC4](https://github.com/dashwin/Sublime-LC4)
- Forked from [CalebAlbers/language-lc3](https://github.com/CalebAlbers/language-lc3)
